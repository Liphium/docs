# Town setup

Welcome to the part of the documentation where I teach you how to deploy a town on your own server. Please understand that I don't have infinite time to cover every method, so if you have anything missing, you can contribute it on the [GitHub repository for this page](https://github.com/Liphium/docs). I'm happy about every single thing we can add to this documentation because there are always people that use something different than you.

For now we have the following guides available:
