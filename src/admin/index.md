# Town administration

Here you can learn everything about how to configure your town and how to make it completely yours.

Be aware that everything in this part of the documentation only covers everything you can change directly in the app. For everything else, you can go to our [configuration guide](../setup/config-setup.md#an-overview-of-the-configuration) for the configuration/environment file for station and look at the overview of the configuration.

If you have any question and don't know where to look, you might want to take a look at the [frequently asked questions](./faq.md) about administration.
