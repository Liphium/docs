# Introduction

Welcome to the new Liphium Documentation, specifically for Town administrators. This will from now on be the place where all advanced tutorials will be put. If you're here as a regular Liphium user wondering how to do some stuff in the app, you may wanna go to the [help & resources page](https://liphium.com/docs) on the main website.

For now, we just have the [guide on how to set up a Town using Docker](/setup/docker.html).

If you're looking at this and wondering how to migrate from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0/0.5.1, you check out the [migration guide](/migration/0.5-migration.html).
