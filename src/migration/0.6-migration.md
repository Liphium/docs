# Migration to station 0.6.0

Hi, it's time for another migration because of another Liphium update, how great! Well this time it's really not a lot, but if you used to official Docker guide to upgrade to this release, you'll have to migrate your Nginx config because it's no longer letting Zap through.

## Everything that changed

- Zap got a few performance improvements and an improved chunking size of 1 MB. In our tests this always performed better than the 512 KB we had before. You can read more about that [in the changelog](https://github.com/Liphium/station/tree/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## How to migrate to 0.6.0

You just have to change your Nginx config for chat server (the thing handling chat messages) and add the following in front of `location / {`.

```sh
# Zap upload endpoint (just to make sure nothing happens)
location /auth/liveshare/upload {
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  client_max_body_size 1100k;
  proxy_pass http://localhost:4001/auth/liveshare/upload;
}
```

## That's it

Well that's already it for this release. We'll have more changes like this that require a little bit of reconfiguration throughout the year I assume, we wanna add audio and video calls back after all. As usual, thanks for using and supporting Liphium! And with that, I wish you a happy rest of your day.
