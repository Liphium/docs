# Migration guides

Welcome to the official place for everything that breaks and changes in Liphium. If anything needs to be changed about your server configuration before updating your Town, you will find it here.

We always leave every single migration guide up which means that you might find ones that are really old. When you upgrade your server, make sure to always use the latest guide. If you're coming from 0.4.0 and want to upgrade to 0.5.0/0.5.1, you can find the latest guide [here](/migration/0.5-migration.md).
