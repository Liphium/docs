# Migration guides

Welcome to the official place for everything that breaks and changes in Liphium. If anything needs to be changed about your server configuration before updating your Town, you will find it here. Just click on the next version above the version you are currently using right in the sidebar and go through all of the guides until you reach the latest version.

We recommend to not enable auto updates on your Docker container simply due to **breaking changes** that might happen. This is not just during the Beta, but it will occasionally happen due to changes we have to make.
